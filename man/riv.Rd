\item{tau}{time difference, \eqn{t-u}.}

\item{k}{parameter \eqn{k}.}

\item{sigma}{parameter \eqn{\sigma}.}
}
\value{
scalar

\description{
Random variable generation for the conditional distribution of the
Integrated Variance (IV), through a Pearson Distribution approximation
which match the first four moments of the unknown true conditional
distribution of IV.
}
\details{
The first four moments are calculated through \code{\link[=invMGF]{invMGF()}}.
\strong{Note that:}
\itemize{
\item when the time difference \code{tau} is very short, like < 0.0001, it is very
likely to introduce computational errors, therefore, we let
\code{iv = tau * (v0+v1)/2} directly.
\item when the computed variance is very small, the computed skewness and
kurtosis are highly un-reliable, therefore, we let \code{iv} equal the mean
directly.
}
}
\examples{
k = 6.21; theta = 0.019; sigma = 0.61; v0 = 0.010201; v1 = v0; tau = 1
iv = riv(v0, v1, tau, k, theta, sigma)
